To create a Python script that compares two documents, you can use libraries like difflib for textual differences, or more specialized tools like docx if the documents are Word files, or pdfminer for PDFs. Here's a simple approach for comparing two text files using difflib.

Script for comparing two text files:
python
Copy code
import difflib

def read_file(file_path):
    """Reads the contents of a file and returns them as a list of lines."""
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.readlines()

def compare_files(file1_path, file2_path):
    """Compares two text files and returns the differences."""
    file1_lines = read_file(file1_path)
    file2_lines = read_file(file2_path)
    
    diff = difflib.unified_diff(file1_lines, file2_lines, lineterm='', 
                                fromfile='File 1', tofile='File 2')
    
    return list(diff)

def save_diff(diff, output_path):
    """Saves the differences to a new file."""
    with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as diff_file:
        diff_file.writelines(diff)

# Example usage:
file1_path = 'file1.txt'  # Replace with the actual path of the first file
file2_path = 'file2.txt'  # Replace with the actual path of the second file
output_diff_path = 'diff_output.txt'  # Path to save the differences

differences = compare_files(file1_path, file2_path)

# Print differences to the console
for line in differences:
    print(line)

# Save differences to a file
save_diff(differences, output_diff_path)
Steps:
Read the files: The read_file function reads the file content into a list of lines.
Compare files: The compare_files function uses difflib.unified_diff to find the differences between the two files.
Save or print differences: The differences are saved to a new file or printed to the console.
You can modify the file paths (file1.txt and file2.txt) to point to your actual documents, and run the script. This will provide a comparison result either as a unified diff output or save it to a file.
